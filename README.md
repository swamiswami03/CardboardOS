# Cardboard Configs
This project was originally a clone of Axarvas Xmonad dotfiles ``` https://github.com/Axarva/dotfiles-2.0 ``` but quickly grew into its own unique configuration of Xmonad

## About CardboardOS
CardboardOS is not a seperate operating system. It is EndeavourOS running Xmonad with a fast, efficient, and productive configuration.Before using CardboardOS I recomend you to first install Axarvas Xmonad dotfiles for all the dependcies that CardboardOS uses. CardboardOS was made to be clean, sleek, fast, and productive, staying out of the users way so you can get more done. You can install and personalize it to fit your style and needs.

## Installing CardboardOS
+ Install Axarvas Xmonad dotfiles
+ Install picom
  + install ``` https://github.com/jonaburg/picom.git ```
  + follow the install instructions on the repo
+ Drag and drop the config files into the correct directories
